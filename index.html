      <h2>About me</h2>
      <hr/>
      <p>
      I'm a web & graphic designer from Serbia, designing user-friendly interfaces with simplicity and beauty in mind for clients around the world.<br/>
      <br/>
      On the digital side, using HTML5 and CSS3 I can create anything from a small static site. All projects are produced with SEO in mind making sure you have a great foundation to build on when it comes to being found in Google. I build sites that do not just look good on your desktop PC, but are also fully responsive so it looks and works great on all tablet devices and phones too.<br/>
      <br/>

      If you need more than just a website then I can also help with branding and any print needs you may have. From business cards and stationery through to brochures and signs, I can help. I can give your brand a refresh or produce your latest company brochure.<br/>
      <br/>
      Whatever your needs and goals do get in touch and I can advise how I can help you take this forward. If you would like to discuss your project or would just like to say hello then do get in touch and drop me a message.<br/>
